Certainly! You can modify the script to filter files based on their creation date. Hereâ€™s an updated version of the script that only searches through HTML files created on a specific date:

```powershell
# Define the directory to start the search
$directory = "C:\path\to\your\directory"

# Define the string to search for
$searchString = "your_search_string"

# Define the specific date for filtering files (YYYY-MM-DD)
$filterDate = Get-Date "2023-06-25"

# Recursively get all HTML files in the directory and subdirectories
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directory -Recurse -Filter "*.html" | Where-Object {
    $_.CreationTime.Date -eq $filterDate.Date
}

# Loop through each file
foreach ($file in $files) {
    # Read the content of the file
    $content = Get-Content -Path $file.FullName

    # Check if the content contains the search string
    if ($content -match $searchString) {
        Write-Output "Found in file: $($file.FullName)"
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Define the directory and search string**: Same as before.
2. **Define the filter date**: The date for filtering files is defined using the `Get-Date` cmdlet. Replace `"2023-06-25"` with the desired date.
3. **Get-ChildItem**: This cmdlet gets all HTML files in the specified directory and its subdirectories.
4. **Where-Object**: This filters the files based on their creation date.
5. **Loop through each file**: For each file that matches the date filter, the script reads the content and checks if it contains the search string.
6. **Output the results**: If the search string is found in a file, the script outputs the file path.

Make sure to replace `C:\path\to\your\directory` with the actual path of the directory you want to search, `your_search_string` with the string you're looking for, and `"2023-06-25"` with the desired date. Save this script in a `.ps1` file and run it using PowerShell.
